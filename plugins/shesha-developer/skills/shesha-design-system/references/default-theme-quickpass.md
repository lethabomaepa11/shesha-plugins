# Default-theme quick pass (invoked by `shesha-form-edit` Step 6.5)

The **cost-capped** styling pass applied to every new form built with **no brand and no design source**, so no form ships unstyled. It is a small, fixed subset of [component-recipes.md](component-recipes.md), pre-resolved with the default `shesha` theme values from `assets/themes/shesha.tokens.json`, and its numbers follow the canonical build style in [default-layout-patterns.md](default-layout-patterns.md). Apply it in **one pass** and return the styled markup — this is a floor, not a design project.

**Hard limits (what makes it "quick"):**
- Do NOT read [capability-matrix.md](capability-matrix.md) or [token-to-prop-mapping.md](token-to-prop-mapping.md) — every value below is already resolved and channel-safe.
- Do NOT run a browser measurement loop.
- Do NOT rewrite the app-level theme — if `$antdTheme` was never applied to the app, note it in the summary and move on (app theme is a once-per-project action, see [app-theme.md](app-theme.md)).
- One pass over the tree; mirror every block across `desktop`/`tablet`/`mobile`; done.
- **0.43 backends: no breakpoint blocks exist** — write the same values as FLAT props on the component model (`backgroundColor`, `borderColor`, `borderRadius`, `height`, `stylingBox`, …) per `shesha-form-edit/assets/components-kb/_shared-style-fields.json`; `desktop.*` blocks are inert there.

## The five treatments

Walk the markup tree once and apply, where each shape exists (skip what the form doesn't have):

### 1. Page root — canvas surface
On the outermost container (or a wrapping container if the form has none):

```json
"desktop": { "background": { "type": "color", "color": "#F8F8F9" },
             "stylingBox": "{\"paddingLeft\":\"24\",\"paddingRight\":\"24\",\"paddingTop\":\"24\",\"paddingBottom\":\"24\"}" }
```

### 2. Cards / section containers — white surface, hairline, radius 8 (border-forward, NO shadow)
Every container that groups a section of fields (and every `card`):

```json
"desktop": { "background": { "type": "color", "color": "#FFFFFF" },
             "border": { "border": { "all": { "width": "1px", "style": "solid", "color": "#E8EAF0" } },
                          "radius": { "all": 8 } },
             "stylingBox": "{\"paddingLeft\":\"16\",\"paddingRight\":\"16\",\"paddingTop\":\"16\",\"paddingBottom\":\"16\",\"marginBottom\":\"16\"}" }
```

Do not add shadows — the default `shesha` brand is border-forward (cards render flat).

### 3. Titles — role-sized ink, weight 600
`text` components acting as headers (color always Nero ink `#181818`, never brand blue; emphasis is weight + colour, never bigger text):

| Role | fontSize | fontWeight |
|---|---|---|
| Page title | 24 | 600 |
| Section / card header | 15–16 | 600 |
| Uppercase micro-label / eyebrow | 11 | 600 (letter-spacing 0.04em) |

### 4. Action row — one buttonGroup, primary from the app theme
The form's `buttonGroup`: confirm exactly one `buttonType: "primary"` item (Submit/Save) with the rest `default` — then leave colours alone. Brand primary (`#003BB2`) comes from the app-level theme; **never repaint buttons per form.** Give the group a top gap: `stylingBox` `{"marginTop":"16"}`.

### 5. Datatable / datalist / status
- Datatable header: `background` `#F8F8F9`, text **12 / 600 / uppercase** `#333333` (letter-spacing 0.04em); rows separated by 1px `#F0F2F5` dividers only — no zebra stripes.
- `refListStatus` chips: **radius 12 (rounded-rect, not a full pill)**, fontSize 10.5–11, fontWeight 600, uppercase, padding 4px 10px, tones from the token file's `statusLifecycle.badges` (draft grey, success green `#E8F5E9`/`#007E00`, warning `#FFF8E1`/`#E65100`, error `#FFEBEE`/`#B71C1C`, info `#EEF2FF`/`#003BB2`).
- Full anatomy (row heights, toolbar, list cards, KIB strips, tabs, modals): [default-layout-patterns.md](default-layout-patterns.md) — consult it when the form has those shapes; skip for a plain field form.

## Rules

- `stylingBox` is a JSON **string**; text components take `fontSize`/`fontWeight` as direct props (see the gotchas in SKILL.md).
- Never touch structure, `propertyName`s, actions, or `formSettings` — style only. If structure looks wrong, report it back; do not fix it here.
- Preserve every existing style the author already set — this pass fills gaps, it does not overwrite deliberate values.
- The pass is complete when: page root has the canvas background, every section surface is a white hairline card, every title carries fontSize+fontWeight, and the buttonGroup has exactly one primary. These four markers are what `form-quality.md`'s appearance floor and the `form-auditor` appearance check look for.
