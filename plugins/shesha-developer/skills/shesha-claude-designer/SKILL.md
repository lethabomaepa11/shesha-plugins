name: shesha-claude-designer
description: Use as the ENTRY POINT when the user wants a Shesha app/page/form to MATCH a design they have — a wireframe, an HTML/JSX prototype, a runnable app, a Figma-style kit, or a screenshot set — and asks to realise it in Shesha. Triggers like "build this design in Shesha", "make Requirements Studio look like the Claude design", "turn this prototype into Shesha forms", "implement this mockup across the app". It is the conductor across one or more screens, it comprehends the design into measured layout blueprints, then orchestrates shesha-design-comprehension, shesha-form-edit and shesha-design-system, and verifies the result by measurement. For a single isolated form with no design source, go straight to shesha-form-edit (it ends with a mandatory default-shesha-theme styling pass, so the result is still styled); to style an already-working form, go straight to shesha-design-system.

# Shesha Claude Designer

## Overview

**The conductor for design → on-brand Shesha app.** It does not author form JSON or pick colours — it ingests a design, turns each screen into a **measured layout blueprint**, plans the screens, and delegates: structure to `shesha-form-edit`, styling to `shesha-design-system`, and the placement comprehension + verification to `shesha-design-comprehension`. Its job is to make sure the built app *matches the design* — in layout (measured, not eyeballed) and in brand.

```dot
digraph { rankdir=LR;
  d [label="Claude design\n(source)"];
  ingest [label="1 ingest +\ntier detect"];
  comp [label="2 comprehend\n→ blueprints"];
  plan [label="3 plan screens"];
  build [label="4 build (form-edit)\n+ style (design-system)"];
  verify [label="5 verify:\nstructure · PLACEMENT · visual"];
  d -> ingest -> comp -> plan -> build -> verify;
  verify -> build [label="placement/visual\nmismatch → fix"];
}
```

## When to use

- A design source exists (prototype / kit / screenshots / runnable app) and the goal is to realise it in Shesha across one or more screens.
- **Not** for "add a field to this form" (use `shesha-form-edit`) or "just theme this working form" (use `shesha-design-system`).

## Steps

### Step 1 — Ingest the design
Identify and read the design source; detect its **fidelity tier** (readable source / runnable app / screenshots). Extract the **token set** (palette, type, spacing, radius, shadow, status lifecycle) and the **screen list**. Normalise mixed docs with markitdown for content only. Details: [references/design-ingestion.md](references/design-ingestion.md). Do NOT parse a compiled/offline single-file bundle — serve+run it instead.

### Step 2 — Comprehend each screen into a layout blueprint  ← the placement spine
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `shesha-developer:shesha-design-comprehension`. For each screen, it produces `<workdir>/blueprints/<screen>.blueprint.md` — a measured, annotated layout blueprint with explicit grid columns/spans, nesting, tab assignment, bindings, and a placement `assertions` block. This is what stops container placement from drifting; do not skip it and hand `shesha-form-edit` a prose brief.

**Interpret with the canonical archetype vocabulary.** Read `shesha-design-system/references/default-layout-patterns.md` before comprehension — record bars, KIB strips, 44px-uppercase-header tables, ghost-Add toolbars, item-list cards, flat hairline cards with header strips, underline tabs, right-aligned modal footers. When a design region matches one of those shapes, name it as that pattern in the blueprint (and build it to the pattern's anatomy) instead of re-deriving it from pixels; measure from the design only where it genuinely deviates. Where the design is silent (a screen the mockups don't cover), default to these patterns — never to bare unstyled structure.

### Step 3 — Establish the theme (once) + plan the screens
**First decide the brand.** If the user names a brand, hands over brand tokens, or an app-specific `<brand>.tokens.json` already exists → use that. If the design carries a distinct palette/type → author a new `<brand>.tokens.json` (copy the default, swap values). Otherwise → use the shipped **default `shesha`** brand. The selection rule + the folder to drop a custom brand file into live in `shesha-developer:shesha-design-system` (SKILL.md Step 1). Then hand the token set to `shesha-developer:shesha-design-system` to ensure the brand theme file exists and the app-level theme (primary, font, radius) is set **once**. Then map each design screen to a Shesha form type + archetype (read the archetype straight from each blueprint — don't re-derive it), **resolve each blueprint region to a block-library block** (`shesha-form-edit/assets/blocks` — e.g. `flex-split-main-rail`, `page-header-band`, `rail-panel`) **+ its paired style overlay/recipe** (`shesha-design-system`), so the per-screen plan is `{archetype, blocks[], recipes[]}`; and sequence the build order (list → detail → create is typical). Present the plan + blueprints + cost; gate on user confirmation (unless headless).

### Step 4 — Build each screen (delegate)
Per screen, in order:
- **(a) Structure — REQUIRED SUB-SKILL `shesha-developer:shesha-form-edit`:** pass the screen's `blueprint.md` as the requirements (archetype → seed/blocks, `layout-tree` spans → **flex `container` rows sized via `desktop.dimensions.width`** — never the `columns` component, `bindings` → component + propertyName). It builds native structure, wires CRUD, validates, pushes, publishes.
- **(b) Styling — REQUIRED SUB-SKILL `shesha-developer:shesha-design-system`:** apply the theme's per-component v7 style blocks to the built form. It returns styled JSON; `shesha-form-edit` owns the single push path.

### Step 5 — Verify against the design (three gates, in order)
- **5a — Structural integrity:** archetype built, native components only, layout fully flexed, fields bound. Failures route back to `shesha-form-edit`, not on to styling.
- **5a.5 — PLACEMENT diff (REQUIRED `shesha-design-comprehension`):** re-probe the built, published, table→details-navigated form; diff measured column membership / row grouping / nesting depth / tab assignment against the blueprint `assertions`; route concrete mismatches back to `shesha-form-edit`. This is the gate that proves the build matches the design's *layout*, not just that it renders — its method lives in the `shesha-developer:shesha-design-comprehension` verification loop.
- **5b — Visual audit:** screenshot vs theme; `shesha-design-system` audit-mode returns prop-level fixes (suggestions).

### Step 6 — Confirm
Summarise per screen (form id, blueprint pass/fail, theme applied); cross-link screens (list→detail→create navigation).

## Non-negotiables — conduct, don't build

- **Comprehend before building.** Every screen gets a measured blueprint (Step 2) before `shesha-form-edit` is invoked. A prose layout description is the thing that drifts — never hand one to the builder in place of a blueprint.
- **Placement is verified, not assumed.** Gate 5a.5 re-measures the built form against the blueprint. No screen is "done" until its placement assertions pass.
- **Delegate ownership.** Structure = `shesha-form-edit`; styling = `shesha-design-system`; comprehension + placement verification = `shesha-design-comprehension`. This skill plans, sequences, and gates — it does not author JSON, pick hexes, or push.
- **One push path.** All writes go through `shesha-form-edit`.
- **Read the source, not the bundle.** Run/serve a compiled prototype and probe it (or read un-minified source); never parse a minified single-file bundle.
- **Honesty about gaps.** If a design detail can't be expressed in Shesha, say so — don't claim a pixel match that isn't achievable.
