name: shesha-form-edit
description: Create and edit Shesha form configurations directly via the API. Authenticates as admin, fetches existing markup with Get/GetByName/GetJson, applies the user's requirements (adding, removing, modifying, or restructuring components — or building a brand-new form from scratch), validates against the bundled component-properties index and embedded-script rules, and pushes via Create / UpdateMarkup / ImportJson. Use when the user provides a form id (or module + name) and a set of requirements like "add a sector dropdown above the email field", "make the address tab conditional on AccountType=PBF", "wire the Save button to call /api/.../Submit", or "create a new branded login page using the auth-login pattern". Always prefer this skill over the Shesha MCP `create_form_configuration` tool — the MCP regularly fails with `'dict' object has no attribute 'lower'` and JSON-RPC `-32602` errors, and the direct-API path is more reliable.

# Shesha Form Edit

Round-trip: **GET form JSON → edit → PUT/POST it back**. Also creates new forms (`Create` then `UpdateMarkup`).

> **For any new table / create / detail form, start from the canonical seeds in `assets/examples/` — see [references/examples.md](references/examples.md).** They are real Shesha-standard forms (verified rendering against a live backend) and encode the CRUD wiring most models get wrong: the **Add button opens the create form in a modal** (`Show Dialog`), detail views toggle edit in place (`Start Edit`/`Submit`), child tables use `tabs` + a `permanentFilter` on `{{data.id}}`, and inputs are chosen by the property's data type ([by-datatype.md](references/components/by-datatype.md)). Copy the matching example, swap entity/properties/captions/`formId`s, re-stamp `parentId`s, push. Don't hand-author structure the examples already provide.

Args received: `$ARGUMENTS`. Flags: `--refresh-cache` (ignore TTL, re-distill metadata/seeds), `--no-browser` (skip Step 9 browser smoke), `--no-design` (skip Step 0 / 9.5 design passes), `--level l1|l2|l3|l4|l5` (override Step R routing).

## Non-interactive (headless) runs — read this first

When invoked non-interactively (`claude -p`, a test harness, CI) or when the task supplies a context block (Backend URL / Username / Password / Module / Working directory): **never call `AskUserQuestion` — it dead-ends the run.** Use the supplied context verbatim — it **overrides** Step 1 URL discovery, Step 2 default credentials, and the target module. Defaults for every ask-gate: Step 0 design ask → skip, author from seeds; Step 3 missing form identity → resolve from the task wording against the module's form list (`GetAll`), else create a new form named `{entity-kebab}-{type}` in the context module; push-failure menu → re-fetch & re-apply once, then stop and report; Step 9.5 → skip. **Always end with a summary naming every form created or modified (module + name + id)** — downstream evaluation identifies your work from that output.

## Step R — Route by capability level (always first)

| Level | Request shape | Path | Cost envelope |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | One component / property / script / action on ONE form | Inline. Steps 1–8 only; skip Step 0; Step 9 only if the change is visual/behavioral. | minutes, no agents |
| **L2** | Create or restructure ONE whole form (table / create / details / dialog / subform / custom) | Inline, full Steps 0–10, seed-first from `assets/examples/`. | one context |
| **L3** | One page where backend prerequisites may not exist (entity, property, reflist, API, menu item) | Prereq gate (Step 4.5 / prereq-checker agent) BEFORE any form JSON; fix gaps via the owning skill; forms last. | one context + sibling skills |
| **L4** | Multiple linked pages in one request (CRUD set, dashboard + drill-downs) | Orchestrate per [levels.md](references/levels.md): plan → build create→details→table → cross-link integrity pass. Don't build 3+ forms in one context. | N agents; state the cost first |
| **L5** | A whole application from a brief/spec/image | Decompose → plan checkpoint → waves of L3/L4. | hours; confirm scope first |

Rules: (1) **Default DOWN** — ambiguity picks the lower level; escalate only on a concrete failed check (signals + triggers: [levels.md](references/levels.md)). (2) **Route OUT non-form work** — pure backend asks (reference list, role, notification, background job, API) go straight to the sibling skill, not wrapped in form workflow. (3) `--level l1|l2|l3|l4|l5` in `$ARGUMENTS` overrides detection.

## Step 0 — Design consultation (ask first)

For brand-new forms or major restructures, **ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`** whether to invoke the `frontend-design` skill for a design plan (typography, palette, spatial system, section list):

> Want a design consultation from the `frontend-design` skill for this form? It returns aesthetic direction (~30s extra) before authoring.
> - **Yes — get a design plan** (recommended for new pages / major restructures)
> - **No — author from seeds only** (good for adding fields, small tweaks, internal forms)

On Yes: invoke `Skill(skill="frontend-design", ...)` per [references/design.md](references/design.md); cache the plan at `.claude/cache/shesha-form-edit/design-plans/<form-name>.md` for Step 9.5.

**Don't ask** (skip silently) for: trivial edits (add a field, fix a script, change a propertyName), bug fixes, row-template / sub-form / utility forms, or when `--no-design` is in `$ARGUMENTS`. If `frontend-design` isn't installed, warn the user once and continue without it.

## Step 1 — Resolve backend URL

Order: **task-supplied context block (always wins)** → `src/*.Web.Host/Properties/launchSettings.json` (`profiles.Project.applicationUrl`) → `src/*.Web.Host/appsettings.json` (`Kestrel:Endpoints:Http:Url`) → fallback `http://localhost:21021`. Strip trailing slash. Store as `$BASE_URL`. Ping `$BASE_URL/swagger/index.html` to confirm reachability; if it fails, stop and tell the user to start the backend.

## Step 2 — Authenticate as admin

Task-supplied credentials win; local-dev defaults otherwise: **`admin` / `123qwe`** — don't ask. POST `$BASE_URL/api/TokenAuth/Authenticate` with `{ userNameOrEmailAddress, password }`; extract `result.accessToken` (or `accessToken` on older builds). See [references/api.md §2](references/api.md). If no token, surface raw response and stop.

**Module ID lookup** (needed for `Create`): `GET $BASE_URL/api/services/app/Module/GetAll` (note: `app` namespace — `Shesha/Module/GetAll` returns 404). Find the entry where `name === "<module>"` and take its `id`. Cache it for the session. If a subsequent `Create` call returns `"There is no entity Module with id = …"`, the backend was restarted and the ID changed — re-fetch via this endpoint.

## Step 3 — Identify the form

Required: form id **OR** (module + name). Ask the user only what's missing:

> Which form? Either give me the **id** (Guid), or **module + name** (e.g. `PBF.MembershipManagement` + `member-create`).

If module + name only, resolve via `GetByName` ([api.md §3](references/api.md)). Store as `$FORM_ID`.

## Step 4 — Fetch the current markup

`GET /api/services/Shesha/FormConfiguration/GetJson?id=$FORM_ID` ([api.md §4](references/api.md)). Save to `$env:TEMP\form-current.json`. The response body is a stringified form JSON; parse it. Resulting object has top-level `components` (nested tree) and `formSettings`.

## Step 4.5 — Entity introspection (mandatory for entity-bound forms)

Skip if `formSettings.dataLoaderType === "none"`. Otherwise fetch the entity's metadata and validate every `propertyName` in the edit.

**Get the exact `modelType` string first (critical — wrong type causes 500 errors at runtime):**

The `formSettings.modelType` must be the **exact registered C# class name for THIS backend** — resolve it dynamically every time; never assume or copy a namespace from this doc. The same logical entity is registered under different namespaces across Shesha/BoxStack versions: framework entities like `Person` are `Shesha.Domain.Person` on current versions but `Shesha.Core.Person` on older ones, and a backend may even carry both. **The only authority is the live `EntityConfig` for the running backend.** Getting this wrong causes 500/404 errors in the browser when the loader or `datatableContext` queries the entity (test harness check **C2** fails on any mismatch with the registered `fullClassName`).

Resolve it (in priority order) — and use the result verbatim:
1. **From entity config (authoritative)**: `GET $BASE_URL/api/services/app/EntityConfig/GetMainDataList?maxResultCount=200` — find the entity by `name`, then use its **`fullClassName`** (fall back to `className`) as `modelType`. This is the same string the QA harness compares against, so it is the one that passes C2.
2. **Cross-check against an existing form**: `GET $BASE_URL/api/services/Shesha/FormConfiguration/GetAll?maxResultCount=50` — a form bound to the same entity shows the in-use `modelType`. If existing forms disagree with each other (legacy `Shesha.Core.*` vs current `Shesha.Domain.*`), the EntityConfig `fullClassName` wins.

**Entity existence check**: before building any form, verify the entity exists: `GET $BASE_URL/api/services/app/Metadata/GetProperties?container=<exactModelType>`. If the response returns an empty array or error, the entity does not exist — stop and invoke `Skill(skill="shesha-developer:domain-model")`. Never build forms for entities that don't exist; they silently fail at runtime.

1. Read `formSettings.modelType` (the exact class name resolved above).
2. Fetch `GET $BASE_URL/api/services/app/Metadata/GetProperties?container=<modelType>` — returns `result` as a direct array of properties (not wrapped). Cache to `.claude/cache/shesha-form-edit/metadata/<entity>.raw.json`.
3. **Validate `propertyName` against the property list** for every input component you're adding/editing. Surface mismatches before push.

Metadata semantics (`referenceListName` is the full dotted name used **without** any `RefList` prefix; `entityType` is the SHORT class name with `entityModule` separate; FK property names can differ from class names): [api.md §10](references/api.md). Array properties with `listConfiguration.mappingType: "many-to-many"` mean **junction subtables** — read [junction-subtables.md](references/components/junction-subtables.md) before touching those tabs.

TTL 24h; `--refresh-cache` forces re-fetch. If the metadata fetch returns nothing or surfaces a malformed entity, optionally invoke `Skill(skill="shesha-developer:test-entity-crud-api", args="--no-fix")` and fix entity bugs before continuing — a form bound to a broken entity will look fine in markup but fail at runtime.

**For a NEW entity-bound form, or any entity/junction not already verified this session: dispatch the `shesha-developer:fullstack-prereq-checker` agent** (Task tool; pass backend URL, token-file path, and the entity list) and block until its verdict is `ready` — its failures name the fixing skill per gap. Inline checks remain fine for small edits to an already-rendering form. Catalog of backend-rooted symptoms: [full-stack-prereqs.md](references/full-stack-prereqs.md).

## Step 5 — Apply the user's requirements

Read **only** the topic files relevant to the edit. Most edits need 1–3 files:

| Topic | File |
|---|---|

| Embedded scripts, current user, async/try-catch | [references/components/scripts.md](references/components/scripts.md) |
| Shared state (appContext, pageContext) | [references/components/shared-state.md](references/components/shared-state.md) |
| editMode, visibility, permissions | [references/components/edit-mode.md](references/components/edit-mode.md) |

| Layout pattern (full-page forms, auth) | [references/components/layout.md](references/components/layout.md) |
| Style override debugging (5 channels, breakpoints, legacy `style` string) | [references/components/style-channels.md](references/components/style-channels.md) |
| Detail page anatomy (header band, KIB, label alignment) | [references/components/detail-page-pattern.md](references/components/detail-page-pattern.md) |
| M:M junction subtables — link, drill-down, delete/unlink | [references/components/junction-subtables.md](references/components/junction-subtables.md) |
| Add/create dialogs, formArguments, onPrepareSubmitData | [references/components/add-dialogs.md](references/components/add-dialogs.md) |
| Form quality contract (always-on construction rules) | [references/form-quality.md](references/form-quality.md) |
| Adding forms to the app navigation/menu | [references/navigation-menu.md](references/navigation-menu.md) |
| Edits across many forms (pilot-first transforms) | [references/bulk-operations.md](references/bulk-operations.md) |
| Multi-agent fleet dispatch, verdict schemas, cost table | [references/orchestration.md](references/orchestration.md) |
| Browser testing, IndexedDB cache, layout measurement | [references/verification.md](references/verification.md) |
| Symptoms whose fix is backend (reflists, junction DTOs, GQL) | [references/full-stack-prereqs.md](references/full-stack-prereqs.md) |

**Touching more than ~3 forms?** Read [references/bulk-operations.md](references/bulk-operations.md) first — pilot-first is mandatory. Mutations go through **one `shesha-developer:fleet-transformer` agent** (never per-form authoring agents); audits fan out **one `shesha-developer:form-auditor` per form**. Dispatch templates + cost table: [references/orchestration.md](references/orchestration.md).

**Authoring 2+ genuinely distinct new forms?** Dispatch one `shesha-developer:form-author` agent per form in parallel (each gets the seed, metadata, requirements, and an output path); you audit and push centrally afterwards. A single new form stays in-context.

**Seed discovery for new forms** (in this order):
1. **`assets/examples/` — CANONICAL Shesha-standard seeds. Start here for any table / create / detail form.** See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for the index and the CRUD-loop wiring (modal Add button, Start Edit/Submit detail header, child-table tabs). Copy the matching example and change only `modelType`/`entityType`/`propertyName`/captions/`formId`s. This is the highest-priority source — these forms render correctly and follow standards.
2. `assets/patterns/` — other vendor seeds (index: [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md)).
3. `.claude/cache/shesha-form-edit/seeds/` — project-specific forms cached from prior edits.
4. **MCP `search_forms`** — query `mcp__shesha__search_forms` for forms in this backend matching the layout type. Use the closest match as a seed; cache it under `seeds/` for next time.
5. Author from scratch only if no seed fits — guided by the design plan from Step 0.

**Picking the input component for each field** — driven by the property's `dataType` (string→textField, number→numberField, date→dateField, reference-list-item→dropdown, entity FK→autocomplete, …). Full table + config in [references/components/by-datatype.md](references/components/by-datatype.md).

**Proactive doc fetch**: when the user's requirements mention non-trivial mechanisms (wizard, OTP, navigator, complex appContext composition, custom action chaining), `WebFetch` the relevant `shesha-grads.vercel.app` / `docs.shesha.io` page **before** writing scripts. Distill into `.claude/cache/shesha-form-edit/docs/<topic>.summary.md` (~30 lines) so subsequent edits don't re-fetch.

**Component plan + index check (mandatory, blocking — do this before writing any component JSON)**:

For every new or edited form, before writing a single component object:

1. **List every component `type` you plan to use.** (e.g. for a table form: `container`, `text`, `button`, `datatableContext`, `datatable`)

2. **Confirm each type exists** in the component index at `assets/groups/index.json` (bundled in this skill's assets folder). If a type is missing, you have the wrong name. The index is the authoritative source for the exact `type` string used in form JSON (e.g. `datatableContext` not `dataTableContext`; `datatable` not `dataTable`).

3. **Load the group file** for each component type (the index maps type → group file). Read the group file to get the full list of valid property names, their expected types, and descriptions. Only use properties listed there — anything else will be stripped by `clean-form-config` at Step 6.

4. **Scan the group for alternatives.** While in the group file, check whether a better-fit component exists (e.g. `refListStatus` instead of `dropdown` for read-only status display, `columns` instead of nested `container` for side-by-side layout).

5. **Update the plan** with corrected type names, valid properties, and any swapped alternatives — then write the JSON.

Tree-editing principles: preserve every existing component's `id` and `parentId` (fresh GUIDs only on clones / new nodes); when re-parenting, update only the moved node and add it to the new parent's `components`; don't touch `formSettings` unless asked.

**`parentId` is mandatory on every component** — the Shesha renderer uses it to build the component tree and crashes entirely when it is absent. Set `parentId` to the direct parent component's `id`. Components at the root level of a form get `parentId: "root"`. Components inside a `columns` slot get `parentId` equal to the `columns` component's `id` (not the slot's own `id`). Use a recursive stamping pass before push:

```js
function stampTree(nodes, parentId) {
  return nodes.map(node => {
    if (!node?.type) return { ...node, components: stampTree(node.components||[], parentId) }; // col slot
    const n = { ...node, parentId };
    if (n.components) n.components = stampTree(n.components, node.id);
    if (n.columns)    n.columns    = stampTree(n.columns,    node.id);
    if (n.tabs)       n.tabs       = n.tabs.map(t => ({ ...t, components: stampTree(t.components||[], node.id) }));
    if (n.content?.components) n.content = { ...n.content, components: stampTree(n.content.components, node.id) }; // card / collapsiblePanel slot
    if (n.header?.components)  n.header  = { ...n.header,  components: stampTree(n.header.components,  node.id) };
    return n;
  });
}
// Usage: markup.components = stampTree(markup.components, 'root');
```

## Step 5.5 — Pre-push JSON safety check (mandatory)

Before calling UpdateMarkup, run this Node snippet to catch JSON-in-JSON errors that will cause `"Expected ',' or ']' after array element in JSON"` in the browser:

```js
const markup = { /* your form object */ };
try {
  const str = JSON.stringify(markup);
  JSON.parse(str);        // must not throw
  JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({ markup: str })); // round-trip test
  console.log('JSON OK, length:', str.length);
} catch (e) {
  console.error('BROKEN JSON:', e.message);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

Common causes of failure: template literals (`` `${x}` ``) inside `dynamicEndpoint` or script fields — replace with string concatenation; literal newline characters in string values — replace with `\n`.

## Step 6 — Validate

Walk tree (unique ids, valid types, valid parent chain); dead-prop check: look up each component's group in `assets/groups/index.json`, then validate its props against that group file; runtime-type checks (booleans not `"true"`, numbers not `"42"`); dropdown `values` shape (`{ id, label, value }`); `node --check` each script string. Then run the **[form-quality checklist](references/form-quality.md)** — validationErrors present, human-readable labels, dropdown sources complete, primary action visible, consistent layout.

Then **invoke `clean-form-config` (mandatory, blocking)** — covers layout overflow, label-vs-propertyName refs, missing try/catch, missing async, broken script syntax:

```
Skill(skill="shesha-developer:clean-form-config", args="<path to your edited form>")
```

If validation fails, present issues to the user before pushing. **Never push a config that fails validation without user confirmation.**

**Before any bulk push (>3 forms changed): fan out `shesha-developer:form-auditor` agents — one per form** — with the verdict contract from [orchestration.md](references/orchestration.md); aggregate and never push a form with a `fail` verdict.

## Step 7 — Push

Default: **UpdateMarkup** — `PUT $BASE_URL/api/services/Shesha/FormConfiguration/UpdateMarkup`, body `{ "id": "$FORM_ID", "markup": "<stringified form JSON>" }`. Build the body in Node to avoid escaping pain. See [api.md §5](references/api.md).

Alternative: **ImportJson** — multipart upload (`ItemId` + `file`). See [api.md §6](references/api.md). Both write `Markup` on the form configuration.

Success: HTTP 200 with `{ "result": ... }`.

### On push failure (any non-200)

1. Surface the raw response and a short diagnosis.
2. Ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`: **retry as-is** / **re-fetch and re-apply** / **abort**.
3. Act on the choice. **Never silently retry. Never just stop.**

## Step 8 — Verify

Re-fetch via `GetByName`/`GetJson`; diff against what you sent. Surface any normalization the server applied. For anonymous forms (`access: 5`), confirm `result.access === 5` — the `Create` endpoint may not honor `access` on initial create; call `UpdateMarkup` once more if it didn't stick.

## Step 8.5 — Diagnose common runtime errors

After verifying, watch for these patterns in the browser console or from Playwright:

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `HTTP 400` on datatableContext data load | Entity doesn't have GQL query API enabled in backend | Invoke `shesha-developer:domain-model` to enable GQL on entity, or use `sourceType: "Url"` with an explicit REST endpoint |
| `HTTP 404` on metadata fetch (`"Failed to fetch metadata of type …"`) | Wrong entity class name in `formSettings.modelType` | Re-verify entity type via `EntityConfig/GetMainDataList` or `FormConfiguration/GetAll` on existing forms |
| `HTTP 500` on datatableContext | `entityType` or `sourceType` missing on `datatableContext` component | Add `entityType`, `sourceType: "Entity"`, `dataFetchingMode`, `defaultPageSize`, `uniqueStateId` |
| `JSON parse error` in browser console | Malformed script string in form markup — template literals or literal newlines | Run Step 5.5 JSON safety check; replace template literals with concatenation |
| Form shows blank/empty without error | Short IDs (`pr1`, `btn2`) or all-`root` parentIds | Re-run `stampTree`; ensure `crypto.randomUUID()` IDs |
| Detail form shows blank when navigated to without `?id=` | Normal — `gql` loader has no ID to fetch | This is expected; test detail forms with `?id=<real-guid>` |
| Create/edit fields show as read-only labels (no input boxes) standalone | `editMode: "inherited"` + form not in edit context | Expected — they become inputs inside the Add modal (`formMode: "edit"`) or after Start Edit. Don't "fix" by forcing `editable`. |
| Dropdown opens but shows "No matches" / no options | The backend **reference list has no items**, or wrong `referenceListId` | Verify the reflist name via property metadata; confirm items exist in the backend reflist editor. Config itself (see by-datatype.md) is likely correct. |
| Autocomplete (FK) shows "No matches" | Target entity has no records, or wrong `entityType:{name,module}` | Confirm the FK target short class name + module; ensure records exist. |
| Junction/child `Crud/Create` 500 on dialog submit | Contextually-preset FK never reached the payload (`_formFields` rule) | Real component + `formSettings.onPrepareSubmitData` — see [add-dialogs.md](references/components/add-dialogs.md) |
| Push returned 200 but the browser shows old markup | Frontend IndexedDB form cache | Clear from a static page (`/favicon.ico`) — see [verification.md](references/verification.md) |

Full catalog (~40 rows, grouped): [references/debug.md](references/debug.md).

## Step 9 — Browser smoke (default; `--no-browser` opts out)

Invoke the playwright skill to load the form, screenshot, and capture console + network errors that JSON validation can't catch (editMode regressions, runtime script failures, broken layout). Recipe in [api.md §12](references/api.md):

```
Skill(skill="playwright", args="<directive from api.md §12, with FRONTEND_URL + form path filled in>")
```

Frontend URL: `adminportal/` (auth forms) or `publicportal/` (anonymous) — read the dev port from `<app>/.env*` or `<app>/package.json`. If neither front-end is running, skip the smoke step and warn the user.

Test `*-details` forms via the **table row's view link**, never a pasted `?id=` URL — direct loads render but subtable Add/Create submits 500 (missing page context). If the browser disagrees with a verified API re-fetch, clear the **IndexedDB form cache from `/favicon.ico`** before debugging further. Verify layout claims with `getBoundingClientRect`, not screenshots. Full recipes: [references/verification.md](references/verification.md).

**On any captured error or 4xx/5xx**: consult [references/debug.md](references/debug.md) before guessing — it maps common symptoms to causes. Quote the captured error verbatim; reference the matching row number.

## Step 9.5 — Aesthetic review (ask first; skip if `--no-design` or no Step 0 plan)

If a design plan exists for this form, **ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`** whether to run a post-render aesthetic critique:

> Run an aesthetic review on the rendered form via `frontend-design`? It compares the screenshot against the design plan and returns up to 5 prop-level tweaks.
> - **Yes — review and suggest tweaks**
> - **No — confirm and finish**

On Yes: pass screenshot + plan + original requirements to `frontend-design`. Surface findings as **suggestions, not blockers** — accept/reject per item; on accept, loop back to Step 5 → 8 → 9. Recipe: [references/design.md](references/design.md).

## Step 10 — Confirm

Tell the user: form `$FORM_ID` updated. Authenticated forms render at `/dynamic/<module>/<form>`; anonymous at `/no-auth/<module>/<form>`.

## Cache (`.claude/cache/shesha-form-edit/`)

Project-scoped learning state. **Skill reads `.summary.md` by default; opens raw `.raw.json` only when summary is insufficient.** Layout: `metadata/`, `seeds/`, `docs/`, `_archive/` — see `.claude/cache/shesha-form-edit/README.md`. Populate via `node .claude/skills/shesha-form-edit/scripts/summarize.js <input.json> [--out <out.summary.md>]`. TTLs: metadata 24h; seeds invalidate on `versionNo` change. `--refresh-cache` ignores TTL.

## Non-negotiables

- **`datatableContext` (lowercase t) is the correct type** — `dataTableContext` (capital T) is NOT a valid type and silently renders nothing. The clean-form-config index uses `datatableContext`; use that exact string.
- **`datatableContext` requires explicit `entityType` + `sourceType`** — it does NOT inherit from `formSettings.modelType`. A bare `datatableContext` without these props causes HTTP 500 on page load. Mandatory props: `entityType` (same value as `formSettings.modelType`), `sourceType: "Entity"`, `dataFetchingMode: "paging"`, `defaultPageSize: 10`, `uniqueStateId: "<componentName>"`, `componentName: "<name>"`, `propertyName: "<name>"`. Template:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "datatableContext",
    "entityType": "<resolved modelType — exact EntityConfig fullClassName, same value as formSettings.modelType>",
    "sourceType": "Entity",
    "dataFetchingMode": "paging",
    "defaultPageSize": 10,
    "uniqueStateId": "myTable",
    "componentName": "myTable",
    "propertyName": "myTable",
    "sortMode": "standard",
    "allowReordering": "no"
  }
  ```
- **`parentId` on every component** — set to the direct parent's `id`; root-level components get `"root"`. Use `stampTree` (see Step 5). Missing `parentId` or all-`root` parentIds crashes the Shesha renderer with no useful error.
- **`id` must be a real UUID** — use `crypto.randomUUID()` or `uuid.v4()`. Short placeholder IDs like `btn1`, `pr2` are NOT valid; the renderer ignores components with non-UUID ids, causing forms to render blank.
- **CRUD wiring follows the canonical examples (`references/examples.md`), not ad-hoc navigation:**
  - **Table "Add" button** = a `buttonGroup` item with `buttonAction: "dialogue"`, `actionConfiguration.actionName: "Show Dialog"` (owner `shesha.common`), `actionArguments.formId: { name: "<create-form>", module: "<module>" }`, `modalWidth: "60%"`, `formMode: "edit"`. It opens the create form in a **modal** — verified to render the create form's fields inline. Do NOT make Add a Navigate.
  - **Detail-view lifecycle buttons** = a header `buttonGroup`: Edit → `Start Edit`, Save → `Submit`, Cancel → `Cancel Edit` (all owner `shesha.form`); optional Audit Log → `Show Dialog` → `{ name: "entity-change-audit-log", module: "Shesha" }`. The form toggles edit state in place; there is no manual navigate-back Save.
  - **Toolbar Refresh / column-toggle** buttons use `actionName: "Refresh table"` / `"Toggle Columns Selector"` with `actionOwner` set to the **dataContext component's id**.
  - **Row → detail navigation** (only when a separate detail page is wanted): action column item with `columnType: "action"`, `action: "navigate"`, `targetUrl: "/dynamic/<module>/<form>?id={{selectedRow.id}}"`, `icon: "EditOutlined"`.
- **`actionArguments.target`** for plain Navigate actions: `{ actionName: "Navigate", actionOwner: "shesha.common", actionArguments: { target: "/dynamic/..." } }`.
- **Preserve ids** on existing components — fresh GUIDs only on clones / new nodes.
- **`editMode` is per form type — never blanket-stamp either value.** Detail forms with Start Edit/Submit lifecycle: `"inherited"` (explicit `"editable"` makes fields editable before Edit is clicked). Create/edit dialogs and action/anonymous pages: `"editable"` (`"inherited"` renders dead inputs there). Visual components: omit. Full decision table: [edit-mode.md](references/components/edit-mode.md).
- **Contextually-preset required FKs on create dialogs need BOTH a real component AND `formSettings.onPrepareSubmitData`** — `formArguments`/`setFieldsValue` alone never reach the submit payload (only `_formFields` serialize). Omission = `Crud/Create` 500. See [add-dialogs.md](references/components/add-dialogs.md).
- **Row delete/unlink = Execute Script + `await http.delete(...)` + onSuccess `Refresh table` with actionOwner = the dataContext component id.** `actionName: "Delete row"` with owner `"table"` does not exist and throws. See [junction-subtables.md](references/components/junction-subtables.md).
- **Code-mode props are objects** — a dataContext `endpoint` (or any code-carrying prop) stored as a plain JS string is silently stripped on save; use `{ "_mode": "code", "_code": "..." }`.
- **JSON-safe script strings** — ALL script values embedded in form JSON must be serialisable without breaking the outer `JSON.stringify`. Rules: (a) no template literals — use string concatenation instead of `` `${x}` ``; (b) no unescaped newlines — use `\n`; (c) no smart/curly quotes — use straight quotes; (d) validate every script-containing component with `node -e "JSON.stringify(comp)"` before push. A broken script string produces `"Expected ',' or '}' after property value"` parse errors in the browser.
- **No `globalState`** for cross-form state. Default to `contexts.appContext` (app-wide) or `pageContext` (inter-page). `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` are OK only when state must survive a hard refresh AND the data is not sensitive (no auth tokens / PII) — see [shared-state.md](references/components/shared-state.md).
- **API calls in scripts**: `try/catch` + `async/await` (no `.then()` chains) — see [scripts.md](references/components/scripts.md).
- **Mustache expressions always use `{{double braces}}`** — e.g. `{{data.id}}`, `{{selectedRow.id}}`. Never write `{data.id}` (single brace). Single-brace expressions are silently ignored at runtime, producing empty values with no error.
- **`access: 5`** on anonymous forms (login, register, OTP). Verify post-push via re-fetch.
- **PowerShell + non-ASCII body**: pass UTF-8 bytes (em dashes / curly quotes trigger server 500 — `Unable to translate bytes [E2] ... from specified code page to Unicode`). Use `[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($jsonBody)` or `curl --data-binary @file`. And write staged JSON files **without a BOM** (`New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false`) — `Out-File -Encoding utf8` emits a BOM that breaks Node's `JSON.parse`. Recipe in [api.md](references/api.md).
- **Human-readable labels on every field** — labels are user-facing AND how browser-based tests locate fields; a raw `propertyName` as a label fails both. Full contract: [form-quality.md](references/form-quality.md).
- **`modelType` is resolved, never assumed** — take the exact `fullClassName` from `EntityConfig/GetMainDataList` for the running backend (Step 4.5). Never hardcode a namespace from memory or from this doc's examples; `Shesha.Core.*` vs `Shesha.Domain.*` is version-dependent and a mismatch fails QA check **C2** and 500s at runtime.
- **A `validationErrors` component is ALWAYS in the tree** (conventionally just above the action row) **whenever the form has any required input**. Omitting it makes a failed submit render nothing and fails QA check **F-I7**. Type string is exactly `validationErrors`; it takes no props. This applies to simple forms too — it is not an "advanced" extra.
- **Form action buttons live in a `buttonGroup`, never as standalone `button` components — and the Save button MUST carry `actionConfiguration: { actionName: "Submit", actionOwner: "shesha.form" }`.** Save/Submit, Back/Cancel, Edit, Delete, Refresh, Add — every action goes in a single `buttonGroup` (`items[]` of `{ itemType: "item", itemSubType: "button", buttonType, buttonAction, actionConfiguration }`), not as loose top-level `button` nodes. This is the **single highest-leverage rule** — a standalone `button` (type `"button"`) or a Submit wired to anything other than `Submit`/`shesha.form` cascades into THREE failures at once: (1) **V-A4** fails on the scattered button; (2) the QA classifier detects a form's *intent* ONLY from `buttonGroup` item actions — with no detectable `Submit`/`shesha.form` action it sees "no edit intent" and **misclassifies an editable form as read-only** (then penalises it for having buttons), and (3) the submit-button functional check can't find the action. The standalone `button` type in [actions.md](references/components/actions.md) is reserved for rare inline-in-content cases (e.g. a button beside a paragraph), never the form's action row. A **Back** button is a `buttonGroup` item with `actionName: "Navigate"` (owner `shesha.common`). Canonical structure: copy a `buttonGroup` from a seed in `assets/examples/`.
- **Minimal component count — add only what the request needs.** A "simple form with N fields + Save + Back" is exactly: those N inputs + a `validationErrors` + one `buttonGroup` + the minimum structure to satisfy layout (one `columns`/`sectionSeparator` when >5 inputs). Do NOT pad with extra containers, decorative panels, headers, or duplicate wrappers the user didn't ask for — unnecessary extras fail QA check **C8**. Seeds are a starting point: after copying, strip every node the current request doesn't use.

## Doc fallback

When you hit an unfamiliar API / component / action, fetch docs first via `WebFetch` instead of guessing — `https://shesha-grads.vercel.app/docs/` for practical how-to ("how do I X"), `https://docs.shesha.io/` for canonical contracts ("what is the contract for X"). Quote field names and gotchas verbatim; cache distillates in `.claude/cache/shesha-form-edit/docs/<topic>.summary.md`. If the token expires (24h default), re-run Step 2.
